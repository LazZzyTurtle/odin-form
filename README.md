# Oding Project - Creating a From

In this project I built a sign up form using basic HTML and CSS with client-side validations.

## What I Learned

In this project I learned the following:

- Used HTML and CSS to layout and style elements on the screen
- Used HTML form elements to take in user data and validate them on the client
- Used CSS pseudo-classes to style form elements
